Dr. Kaplanski's work, underscored by 45 papers and multiple patents, reflects his commitment to leveraging technology for optimizing supply chains and enhancing data security. As the founder and leader of teams behind several successful startups, his contributions not only push the boundaries of AI application but also aim to solve complex societal challenges. 

## Education

### Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Computer Science
- **Institution**: Gdańsk University of Technology, Faculty of Informatics and Telecommunication
- **Location**: Gdańsk, Poland
- **Dates**: 06/02/2009 - 23/04/2013
- **Thesis Title**: "Ontology-Aided Software Engineering"
- **Thesis Overview**: Explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, and Software Engineering to address challenges in software development methodologies. The thesis proposes the use of Description Logic as a formalization of software engineering methods and tools, bridging the gap between theoretical principles and practical software development through the novel approach of Ontology-Aided Software Engineering (OASE). This approach leverages Controlled Natural Language for clearer, machine-processable communication within software development, aiming to improve quality, manage knowledge, and enhance the software production process.

### Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computer Science
- **Institution**: Wrocław University of Technology, Faculty of Computer Nets and Systems
- **Location**: Wrocław, Poland
- **Dates**: 01/10/1996 - 17/10/2001
- **Details**: Focused on computer networks and systems, emphasizing the design and optimization of network infrastructures and robust system security measures.

### Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin stands as the pioneering digital currency. Its breakthrough has spawned a myriad of cryptocurrencies and smart contract/blockchain platforms. Yet, developers venturing into the realm of Bitcoin apps face distinct challenges.

Unlike younger counterparts like Ethereum, Bitcoin wasn't designed with programmability in mind. The absence of smart contracts in Bitcoin's architecture fundamentally alters the approach to app development. In this landscape, simplicity is king, and limitations are plentiful. However, it's within these constraints that creativity and ingenuity are truly tested.

As a decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin operates with a very simplified set of computing capabilities, enabled by the Bitcoin Script programming language. This language is not Turing complete, meaning it doesn't have the ability to perform all possible computation tasks. In practical terms, Bitcoin Script is designed for processing simple transactions and cannot execute complex operations or loops, which are possible in Turing-complete languages like those used for Ethereum's smart contracts. This limitation is by design, prioritizing security and predictability in Bitcoin transactions.

Moreover, Bitcoin lacks any form of cloud services and infrastructure, as it is focused on the single task of securing Bitcoin transfers. Fortunately, there are existing supporting technologies that complement its capabilities. In this post, we will explore several of these technologies. As an example, we present NOSTR, a decentralized relay protocol for openly publishing and consuming data. NOSTR stands out for its simplicity and its ability to facilitate decentralized social interactions and information exchange, complementing Bitcoin's infrastructure by enabling a wider range of applications beyond basic transactions.

Another Bitcoin-centric technology that makes a significant difference is the Lightning Network. Bitcoin has a limitation of 1 MB per block approximately every 10 minutes, which hampers its usability for micropayments due to capacity and speed constraints. The Lightning Network, a layer-2 technology built on top of the Bitcoin network, addresses this limitation. It enables transactions at a throughput comparable to conventional payment systems like Visa or Mastercard, thus making micropayments feasible on Bitcoin's infrastructure. This innovation significantly expands the potential applications of Bitcoin, allowing it to handle a much higher volume of transactions and smaller payment amounts efficiently.

## Bitcoin vs. Crypto

If you are a crypto developer from Solana or Ethereum used to working with Solidity, etc., it might seem strange to write about programming apps on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is perceived as old-fashioned, lacking in novelty. It lacks smart contracts and does not allow for zk-rollups, therefore seeming not to scale with demand. Moreover, Bitcoin maximalists seem like a church with an anonymous mystical Messiah (Satoshi), a Bible (The Bitcoin Standard), and a school of thought (Austrian Economics). The crypto space around Ethereum or Solana appears to be a vibrant space where any new idea is welcomed, and projects are colorful, looking like an El Dorado. The crypto space created the web3 movement, aiming to surpass web2 with decentralization, advocating for distributed organizations (DAOs) managed by anonymous stakeholders, etc., with its techonomy.

Bitcoin seems to be mundane. There is no fun there. Even BRC20 - a quite surprising side effect of the Taproot soft fork, which allowed for Bitcoin Ordinals and Inscriptions - is seen by the Bitcoin community as a bug that should be fixed. The Bitcoin network has a single purpose: to move Bitcoins. Movement of bitcoins is limited to a 1MB/10m transfer rate (approx 1.7 kB/s). An average of 4000 transactions per block gives us 6.7 transactions per second (2-3 before SegWit, 7-10 with SegWit) - which is very slow, designed from the beginning, and it does not seem like it is possible to change, as the so-called block-size wars have already proven. Slow, mundane network that is almost impossible to innovate - but on the other side - a solid rock foundation of having only 21 million Bitcoins as a limit of a geometric series reducing Bitcoin inflation every time new 210k blocks are mined.

## Bitcoin and Decentralized Apps Development

The essence of the crypto space can be understood as decentralization. Maintaining a blockchain makes sense only if the goal is to eliminate reliance on trusted, centralized organizations, enabling a system where participants can objectively verify the state of the system without needing to trust anyone. Here, we will discuss decentralized apps (dApps). Centralized apps have been extensively covered elsewhere, focusing on how to build scalable, centralized architectures, such as those in cloud computing.

Web 3.0 is synonymous with decentralization. However, due to its inherent limitations, Bitcoin introduces unique challenges to decentralized app architecture by enforcing a specific separation of responsibilities. Bitcoin secures the monetary aspect of the system, requiring all other functionalities to be handled off-chain. Off-chain computing interacts with the Bitcoin network only in the context of securing Bitcoin assets. A primary interaction point involves Bitcoin transactions, which, in their complex form as Hash Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs), serve as the enabling technology for the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network facilitates the creation of invoices and payments in an onion-routed manner, significantly enhancing Bitcoin's scalability and utility for microtransactions. However, there are a few missing components necessary for comprehensive app development: 

1. Communication infrastructure, 
2. Database, and 
3. Oracles.


## Communication Infrastructure in Mobile Apps

Mobile applications today are designed with diverse communication infrastructures to cater to various user needs, ranging from personal and professional interactions to transactions and community engagement. Here are key examples:
